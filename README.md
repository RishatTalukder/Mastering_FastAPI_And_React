# Mastering FastAPI And React

There are a lot of backend libraries to choose from one of the popular ones is `Django` but a little too heavy for a simple project and as it is a fully stack framwork can be a bit overkill to use with a frontend framework like `React`.

So, to keep things simple(not really) I thought why not choose a library that will do just what it is supposed to do and that is `FastAPI` which is a python framework for building APIs and `React` which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

This repository is for the my `youtube` series on learning `FastAPI` and `React` together.

In this repository you will find some projects that I wanted to do for a very long time and also I might just fails. I will try to make 5 projects:

1. A Simple todo app(the hello world of web development).
2. A image detector. (Just to show how to connect a ml model to a web app).
3. A Simple blog app.
4. A Real time chat app.
5. A project manager app(I don't know if I can do it or not).
6. A Simple e-commerce app.(might use the image detector in it).
7. I haven't decided yet.

I hope this will help you to learn `FastAPI` and `React` together and pray for me because I really don't lnow if I can even do anything after the first project.

> PS: This series will be heavily focused on `fastAPI` but not reactjs. This will be like the continuation of my `reactjs` series. So, if you don't know anything about reactjs then you go watch my `reactjs` series first, also join my discord where I might not help you.

Huhu! Gotcha!
